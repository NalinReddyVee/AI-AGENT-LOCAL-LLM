1. Start your FastAPI server
From your project directory, activate the virtual environment and run:

source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
You should see:

Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
✅ 2. Open Swagger UI
Go to this URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8000/docs

This is FastAPI’s interactive UI to test endpoints.

✅ 3. Upload a File
Use the /upload/ endpoint:

Click POST /upload/

Click "Try it out"

Click "Choose File" and select a .pdf or .docx

Click "Execute"

If successful, you'll see a response like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "filename": "example.docx",
  "chunks_added": 3
}
That means chunks of text from the file were saved to ChromaDB.

✅ 4. Run a Query
Use the /query/ endpoint:

Click POST /query/

Click "Try it out"

In the query field, enter a question relevant to the uploaded file (e.g., "What is OpenAI building?")

Click "Execute"

You should get a response like:


{
  "query": "What is OpenAI building?",
  "matched_doc": "OpenAI is building AGI to benefit humanity.",
  "doc_id": "example.docx"
}
